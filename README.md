# Budget_app

### What the application does

This is a small web application designed to help manage your budget by tracking incomes and expenses built using vanilla Javascript, using HTML and CSS for the frontend. The purpose of its creation was to test my Javascript knowledge and see if I could effectively create and understand the flow of a simple application. Overall I'm happy with the quality of the code produced and it helped my understanding of implementing the module pattern as well as intricate function design.


### How to use the application

* Download the source code using `$ git clone`
* Open the `starter/index.html` file in the browser to view the app

### Dependencies

* Written in **JavaScript**
* Frontend using **HTML**/**CSS**

### Reflections

* This was my first real attempt a creating a professional looking JavaScript application. Even though some elements were challenging I felt like the overall application was a successful and definitely helped me gain a deeper understanding into many elements of Javascript which was the main purpose of its creation.
* If I were to tackle this project again or add additional functionality I would like to refactor using ES6 JavaScript syntax and observe the similarities/differences, I'd also like to add some unit tests in for the source code. On the topic of additional functionality, adding date and time to each income and expense is something I'd like to implement to improve the UX.
* I may eventually look to integrate a database so user sessions and data can be saved. I may also look to deploy the application to the web using Heroku.
